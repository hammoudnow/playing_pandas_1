# playing_pandas_1
This is my effort to work on the vgsales.csv dataset
You can download the csv file here >> https://gist.github.com/zhonglism/f146a9423e2c975de8d03c26451f841e
The code shows how to 
1.import pandas and numpy
2.calculate the mean of "Global_Sales", the minimum, maximum of "Year" columns
3.Use cumulative sum 
4.remove duplicates using .drop_duplicates argument
5.counting using .value_counts argument
6.finally using pivot tables as an alternative to groupby based on two or more columns
